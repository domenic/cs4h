It is recommended that each\nbench focus on a specific point of impact in your application.\n\n![Matcha Report](http://f.cl.ly/items/3X0a1m0S250t2A0W3n1r/matcha-benchmark.png)\n\n## Installation\n\nMatcha is available on npm.\n\n      $ npm install matcha\n\n## Writing Async Benchmarks\n\nThough suites/benches are executed serially, the benches themselves can be asyncronous. Furthermore, suites ran with\nthe matcha command line runner have a number of globals to simplify bench definitions. Take the following code, for example:\n\n```js\nsuite('Make Tea', function () {\n  var tea = new CupOfTea('green');\n\n  bench('boil water', function(next) {\n    tea.boil('85â„ƒ', function (err, h20) {\n      // perfect temperature!\n      next();\n    });\n  });\n\n  // add tea, pour, ...  \n\n  bench('sip tea', function() {\n    tea.sip('mmmm');\n  });\n});\n```\n#### Async vs. Sync\n\nSince boiling water takes time, a `next` function was provided to each iteration in our bench to be called when the\nasync function completes. Since the consumption of tea provides instant gratification, no `next` needed to be provided, even though\nwe still wish to measure it.\n\n#### Setting Options\n\nAs not all code is equal, we need a way to change the running conditions for our benches. Options can currently be changed for\nany given suite, and will be retained for any nested suites or benches of that suite. \n\nTo set an option:\n\n```js\nsuite('Make Tea', function () {\n  set('iterations', 10000);\n  set('type', 'static');\n  // ...\n```\n##### Defaults\n\nHere are all available options and the default values:\n\n```js\nset('iterations', 100);     // the number of times to run a given bench\nset('type', 'adaptive');    // or 'static' (see below)\nset('mintime', 500);        // when adaptive, the minimum time in ms a bench should run\nset('delay', 100);          // time in ms between each bench\n```\n\n##### Static vs Adaptive\n\nThere are two modes for running your benches: 'static' and 'adaptive'. Static mode will run exactly the set number of iterations.\nAdaptive will run the set iterations, then if a minimal time elapsed has not passed, will run more another set of iterations, then\ncheck again (and repeat) until the requirement has been satisfied.\n\n## Running Benchmarks\n\nRunning of your benchmarks is provided through `./bin/matcha`. The recommended approach is to add a devDependancy in your\n`package.json` and then add a line to a `Makefile` or build tool. The `matcha` bin will accept a list of files to load or will \nlook in the current working directory for a folder named `benchmark` and load all files.\n\n      $ matcha suite1.js suite2.js\n\n## Contributing\n\nInterested in contributing?
